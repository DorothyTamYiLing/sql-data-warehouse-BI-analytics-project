# SQL data warehouse and BI analytics project
This project demonstrates a comprehensive data warehousing and analytics solution, from building a data warehouse to generate actionable insights. Based on Udemy course 'The Only SQL Course with 200+ Visual Animations: learn Fast, Practice Hard & Build Real-World Projects' by Baraa.
## Project Components
## Component 1: Building the Data Warehouse (Data Engineering)
#### Objective
Develop a modern data warehouse using SQL Server to consolidate sales data, enabling analytical reporting and informed decision-making.

#### Specifications
- **Database Initialisation**: Creates a new database named 'DataWarehouse' and sets up three schemas 
    within the database: 'bronze', 'silver', and 'gold'. See [SQL script](https://github.com/DorothyTamYiLing/SQL-data-warehouse-BI-analytics-project/blob/main/scripts/data_warehouse_scripts/init_database.sql).
- **Data Sources (bronze layer)**: Import six original tables from two source systems (three tables from Enterprise Resource Planning(ERP) and three tables from Customer Relationship Management (CRM)) provided as CSV files. See [SQL bronze DDL script](https://github.com/DorothyTamYiLing/SQL-data-warehouse-BI-analytics-project/blob/main/scripts/data_warehouse_scripts/bronze/ddl_bronze.sql) and [SQL bronze load script](https://github.com/DorothyTamYiLing/SQL-data-warehouse-BI-analytics-project/blob/main/scripts/data_warehouse_scripts/bronze/proc_load_bronze.sql).
- **Data Quality (silver layer)**: Cleanse and resolve data quality issues prior to analysis. See [SQL silver DDL script](https://github.com/DorothyTamYiLing/SQL-data-warehouse-BI-analytics-project/blob/main/scripts/data_warehouse_scripts/silver/ddl_silver.sql) and [SQL silver load script](https://github.com/DorothyTamYiLing/SQL-data-warehouse-BI-analytics-project/blob/main/scripts/data_warehouse_scripts/silver/proc_load_silver.sql)
- **Integration (gold layer)**: Combine both sources into a single, user-friendly data model designed for analytical queries. See [SQL gold DDL script](https://github.com/DorothyTamYiLing/SQL-data-warehouse-BI-analytics-project/blob/main/scripts/data_warehouse_scripts/gold/ddl_gold.sql).
- **Scope**: Focus on the latest dataset only; historization of data is not required.
- **Documentation**: Provide clear documentation of the data model to support both business stakeholders and anakytical teams.

## Component 2: BI Analytics & Reporting (Data Analytics)

### Objective
Develop and visualise SQL-based analytics to deliver detailed insights into customer behaviour, product performance and sales trends. These insights empower stakeholders with key business metrics, enabling strategic decision-making.

__Exploratory Data Analyses (EDA):__

Database exploration: explores the structure of the database, including the list of tables and their schemas and columns, and metadata for specific tables. [See SQL script](https://github.com/DorothyTamYiLing/SQL-data-warehouse-BI-analytics-project/blob/main/scripts/BI_analytic_scripts/01_database_exploration.sql)

Dimension exploration: explores the structure of dimension tables. [See SQL script](https://github.com/DorothyTamYiLing/SQL-data-warehouse-BI-analytics-project/blob/main/scripts/BI_analytic_scripts/02_dimensions_exploration.sql)

Date exploration: determines the temporal boundaries of key data points and to understand the range of historical data. [See SQL script](https://github.com/DorothyTamYiLing/SQL-data-warehouse-BI-analytics-project/blob/main/scripts/BI_analytic_scripts/03_date_range_exploration.sql)

Measures exploration: calculates aggregated metrics (e.g., totals, averages) for quick insights. [See SQL script](https://github.com/DorothyTamYiLing/SQL-data-warehouse-BI-analytics-project/blob/main/scripts/BI_analytic_scripts/04_measures_exploration.sql) 

Magnitude exploration: quantifies data and group results by specific dimensions and for understanding data distribution across categories. [See SQL script](https://github.com/DorothyTamYiLing/SQL-data-warehouse-BI-analytics-project/blob/main/scripts/BI_analytic_scripts/05_magnitude_analysis.sql)

Ranking exploration: ranks items (e.g., products, customers) based on performance or other metrics and to identify top performers or laggards. [See SQL script](https://github.com/DorothyTamYiLing/SQL-data-warehouse-BI-analytics-project/blob/main/scripts/BI_analytic_scripts/06_ranking_analysis.sql)


__Advance analytics:__

Change-over-time: to track trends, growth, and changes in key metrics over time. [See SQL script](https://github.com/DorothyTamYiLing/SQL-data-warehouse-BI-analytics-project/blob/main/scripts/BI_analytic_scripts/07_change_over_time_analysis.sql)

Cumulative analysis: to calculate running totals or moving averages for key metrics. [See SQL script](https://github.com/DorothyTamYiLing/SQL-data-warehouse-BI-analytics-project/blob/main/scripts/BI_analytic_scripts/08_cumulative_analysis.sql)

Performance analysis (Year-Over-Year, Month-Over-Month): to measure the performance of products, customers, or regions over time. [See SQL script](https://github.com/DorothyTamYiLing/SQL-data-warehouse-BI-analytics-project/blob/main/scripts/BI_analytic_scripts/09_performance_analysis.sql)

Part-to-whole analysis: to compare performance or metrics across dimensions or time periods, useful for A/B testing or regional comparisons. [See SQL script](https://github.com/DorothyTamYiLing/SQL-data-warehouse-BI-analytics-project/blob/main/scripts/BI_analytic_scripts/11_part_to_whole_analysis.sql)

Data segmentation: to group data into meaningful categories for targeted insights. [See SQL script](https://github.com/DorothyTamYiLing/SQL-data-warehouse-BI-analytics-project/blob/main/scripts/BI_analytic_scripts/10_data_segmentation.sql)

       - average order revenue (AOR)  (for each order, sale_amount/quantity)  
       - average monthly revenue  

#### Analytics visualisation

Using filtering function in PowerBI, below visualisations are based on data ranges from 2011 to 2013 (i.e. years with complete 12 months records). See [Microsoft Power BI Desktop Document (.pbix) file](https://github.com/DorothyTamYiLing/SQL-data-warehouse-BI-analytics-project/blob/main/docs/SQL_visuals_2.pbix) for detailed visualisation settings.

Figure 5 (screenshot): Change of sum of quantity sold, count of distinct customer and sum of sales amount (secondary y-axis) over time, sliced by product category. These metrics had increased dramatically from the beginning of 2013 onwards. Using product category slicing, sales categories related to Accessories and Clothing only became significant from the beginning of 2013 onwards. Data from gold.fact_sales_productmerge (i.e. gold.fact_sales table merged with product category information from gold.dim_product in PowerBI)

<img width="990" height="607" alt="Screenshot 2026-01-05 133613" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/caa91284-ea6f-4b88-86b4-7da53661fe8a" />
Figure 6 (screenshot): Count and percentage of orders by product category. Based on the information from the Date slicer, the orders of Accessories and Clothing only started at the end of 2012. Since then, the orders of Accessories product category increased significantly until its cumulative order number surpassed that of Bikes in April 2013. At the same time, Accessories has also become the most popular product category in the year of 2013. Data from gold.fact_sales_productmerge (i.e. gold.fact_sales table merged with product category information from gold.dim_product in PowerBI)

<img width="999" height="606" alt="Screenshot 2026-01-05 134559" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/91dd5758-9515-499d-ba59-286ed14f4f72" />
Figure 7 (screenshot): Count of customer by age group. Based on the slicer, the proportions of customers of different age groups remains relatively constant across different customer segmentation slicers, suggesting the lack of association between age group and customer segmentation. Data from gold.Customers_Report.
